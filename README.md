# Koa Starterpack

The goal of this project is to have a base app that is built on top of the Koa Framework, that includes some of the more common features in web development, such as Authentication, connecting to a MySQL Database, posting content, etc...

It will have a mix of general server side rendered content as well as client side rendered using React.  For state management I will use Redux.
